# Problem Statement: Write selenium scripts to automate the "Add to Cart" project and test it
### 1. Start a new sample app or clone an existing one
### 2. Test the following things with selenium
 - Test 1 - /home - When this route is hit, it should list all the product
 - Test 2 - Each product card will have a  price and an 'add to cart' button
 - Test 3 - When add-to-cart is clicked, that product is added to cart

 - Test 4 - /cart - When this route is hit, it should list all the products in cart
 - Test 5 - Each product in cart can be added/increased in quantity, and hence the total cart value adjusts/reflects to that
 - Test 6 - Each product in cart can be removed, and hence the total cart value adjusts/reflects to that
